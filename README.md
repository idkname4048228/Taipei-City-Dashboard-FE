Taipei Codefest is hosted by the Taipei City Government to promote and accelerate the open-source effort of Taipei City Dashboard. Contestants will attempt to create more than 4 new components for Taipei City Dashboard in 32 hours. With a top prize of NT$300,000 and unlimited food during the contest, this is definitely an opportunity you wouldn't want to miss.

## Introduction

Taipei City Dashboard is a data visualization platform developed by [Taipei Urban Intelligence Center (TUIC)](https://tuic.gov.taipei/en).

Our main goal is to create a comprehensive data visualization tool to assist in Taipei City policy decisions. This was achieved through the first version of the Taipei City Dashboard, which displayed a mix of internal and open data, seamlessly blending statistical and geographical data.

Fast forward to mid-2023, as Taipei City’s open data ecosystem matured and expanded, our vision gradually expanded as well. We aimed not only to aid policy decisions but also to keep citizens informed about the important statistics of their city. Given the effectiveness of this tool, we also hoped to publicize the codebase for this project so that any relevant organization could easily create a similar data visualization tool of their own.

Our dashboard, made yours.

Based on the above vision, we decided to begin development on Taipei City Dashboard 2.0. Unlike its predecessor, Taipei City Dashboard 2.0 will be a public platform instead of an internal tool. The codebase for Taipei City Dashboard will also be open-sourced, inviting all interested parties to participate in the development of this platform.

We have since completed the initial layouts and basic functionalities of Taipei City Dashboard 2.0 and feel the time is right to begin sharing the development process with the general public. From now on, you will be able to suggest features and changes to Taipei City Dashboard and develop the platform alongside us. We are excited for you to join Taipei City Dashboard’s journey!
